# A first-level heading Introduction to Salesforce Developer Experience Framework Project
## A second-level heading Overview
This project demonstrates the power of the Salesforce Developer Experience (DX) framework by showcasing how to leverage Salesforce CLI and Apex commands to manage data and create custom objects from a spreadsheet. The primary goal is to build a fully-fledged application that not only visualizes data on maps but also displays relevant details like name and address for each object.

## A second-level heading Features
>1.Data Management: Utilizing Salesforce CLI commands, we can seamlessly import data from a spreadsheet into custom objects within our Salesforce org. This process ensures that all data is accurately represented and easily accessible.

>2.Custom Object Creation: With the Salesforce DX framework, we can efficiently create custom objects tailored to our specific use case. This allows us to structure the data in a way that optimizes the application's performance and functionality.

>3.Map Visualization: The application includes a map feature that visually represents the data on an interactive map. This allows users to gain insights and identify patterns or trends based on geographical information.

>4.Details Display: Alongside the map, the application provides additional details for each object, such as name and address. This contextual information enhances the user experience and helps users understand the data better.

## A second-level heading How to Use the Project
